The “Recommended Colors” palettes should be generated based upon Domain Onboarding (as it functions today with Website Onboarding). These should be simple 2-color palettes.

The currently selected color scheme should be highlighted with a 2px primary colored stroke. The selected color scheme pill should have a 1px white stroke instead of the 1px grey-light-3 stroke unselected color scheme pills have

Hovering a “Recommended Colors” color scheme should be highlighted with a 2px primary-dark colored stroke. The selected color scheme pill should have a 1px white stroke instead of the 1px grey-light-3 stroke unselected color scheme pills have

Selecting a “Recommended Colors” pill should change the stroke to primary coloring. The new colors should be applied to the live preview.

Hovering the “Custom” button under “Custom Color” should change its dotted stroke to a solid 2px primary-dark stroke. The text and icon should change from primary to primary-dark coloring.

Clicking the “Custom” button under “Custom Color” hides the “Custom” button and exposes the “Custom Color” options. 

The default colors selected should be based off of whatever “Recommended Colors” option was selected previously. The swatch icons within the color cubes (next to the Hex values) should change coloring to remain legible.

Hovering over the navigation tiles should show a hover state, changing them to primary-dark 1 coloring and showing a tooltip with that section’s title

Controls should have hover states, slightly darkening in color on hover (from primary to primary-dark 1)

Toggling “Shape” off should hide all of the “Shape” controls and the live preview should be updated.

Hovering over the navigation tiles should show a hover state, changing them to primary-dark 1 coloring and showing a tooltip with that section’s title

If any component is not enabled then its control option under “Custom Color” should be in a disabled state of grey-light-3 coloring. The pill should change to only show the colors that are enabled. In this example, “Shape” was toggled off.

Hovering a color swatch option should show a 2px primary-dark stroke around it

Clicking a “Custom Color” color swatch should open a floating color picker. It should contain a selection of ROYGBIV+B&W colors.

By default the current color is selected. The custom swatch should be highlighted with a primary--light 1 stroke. The “Apply” button should be disabled until a new color is entered. The Hex text field text should be highlighted, allowing the user to easily paste a new hex in.

Hovering any “Custom Color” color swatch should show a hover effect of a primary--light 1 outline

Clicking any “Custom Color” color swatch should select it and set it in the preview. The swatch itself should have a selected state of a primary--light 1 outline. The Hex text input should update to show its Hex #, the value picker and the linear color selector should change to that color. The “Apply” and “Cancel” CTAs should become enabled, brightening in color. 

Once enabled, the “Cancel” CTA button should have a hover effect, it’s background and text lightening slightly in color when hovered.

If the user cancels at this point, the color picker should close and the color being edited should revert back to the initial selection and the live preview should update.

Clicking outside of the color picker should also “Cancel”

Once enabled, the “Apply” CTA button should have a hover effect, darkening in color when hovered.

Clicking “Apply” saves the selection and closes the picker. The new color should appear in the swatches and the hex value should update to the new one. The live preview should retain this color selection.
